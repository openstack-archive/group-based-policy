    # cd /opt/stack/gbp/devstack/exercises/nfp_service
    # bash lb_base.sh

(2) Login to the UI, create one member in consumer group and two members
    in provider group. Consumer member is HTTP client and provider members
    should have webserver deployed.

    between the two provider members.

(4) Delete members created in the consumer and provider groups in step 2.

(5) Delete the test chain.
    # cd /opt/stack/gbp/devstack/exercises/nfp_service
    # bash lb_base_clean.sh


Steps to test Base Mode with VM:
================================
(1) Create a test chain with the service VM.
    # cd /opt/stack/gbp/devstack/exercises/nfp_service
    # bash fw_base_vm.sh

(2) Login to the UI, create a member in the consumer and provider groups.

(3) Test firewall with traffic from consumer VM.

(4) Log-in into service VM
    # cd /opt/stack/gbp/gbpservice/tests/contrib/diskimage-create/output
    # sudo ip netns exec nfp-proxy /bin/bash
    # ssh -i ./nfp_reference_service_<timestamp> ubuntu@<nfp_service mgmt-ip>

(5) Delete members created in the consumer and provider groups in step 2.

(6) Delete the test chain.
    # cd /opt/stack/gbp/devstack/exercises/nfp_service
