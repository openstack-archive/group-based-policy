    between the two provider members.

(4) Delete members created in the consumer and provider groups in step 2.

(5) Delete the test chain.
    # cd /opt/stack/gbp/devstack/exercises/nfp_service
    # bash lb_base_clean.sh


Steps to test Base Mode with VM:
================================
(1) Create a test chain with the service VM.
    # cd /opt/stack/gbp/devstack/exercises/nfp_service
    # bash fw_base_vm.sh

(2) Login to the UI, create a member in the consumer and provider groups.

(3) Test firewall with traffic from consumer VM.

(4) Log-in into service VM
    # cd /opt/stack/gbp/gbpservice/contrib/nfp/tools/image_builder
    # sudo ip netns exec nfp-proxy ssh -i nfp_reference_service ubuntu@<nfp_service mgmt-ip>

(5) Delete members created in the consumer and provider groups in step 2.

(6) Delete the test chain.
    # cd /opt/stack/gbp/devstack/exercises/nfp_service
