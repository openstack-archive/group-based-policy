Fresh Installation Steps:
=========================

(1) Clone stable mitaka devstack.
    # git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-dev/devstack -b stable/mitaka

(2) Get local.conf.nfp from NFP devstack patch and copy to devstack directory
    as local.conf
    # cd devstack/
    # wget -O local.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/group-based-policy/master/devstack/local.conf.nfp

(3) Configure local.conf
    # Modify NFP_DEVSTACK_MODE to 'advanced'
    # Configure the following external network details.
    # If configured, install step creates resources required for external access.
    # If not configured, user needs to create these resources as described in step 5 below.
      EXT_NET_GATEWAY=
      EXT_NET_ALLOCATION_POOL_START=
      EXT_NET_ALLOCATION_POOL_END=
      EXT_NET_CIDR=

    # Configure the Configurator (NFP Controller) VM image path(optional),
    # If configured, install step uploads the specified image
    # If not configured, install step will build a new one and upload it
      ConfiguratorQcow2Image=

    # Configure Service VM image paths(optional),
    # If configured, install step uploads the specified images
    # If not configured, install step ignores uploading these service images
      VyosQcow2Image=
      HaproxyQcow2Image=

    # Configure PUBLIC_INTERFACE with the public interface name

(4) Install devstack.
    # ./stack.sh

(5) Create required basic GBP resources
    # In step 3 above, if you have chosen not to create resources for external access, you may need
    # to create them explicitly as described below.
    # Note: This step is not required to excercise east west traffic
    # Create external-network, external-subnet, external-segment, nat-pool, network-service-policy
    # Configure "default_external_segment_name" option from "group_policy_implicit_policy" group
    # with external-segment name created above  from neutron.conf
    # Restart neutron-server service
