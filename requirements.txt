# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.

# REVISIT: Until co-gating and/or stable branches are implemented for
# the aci-integration-module repo, it may be necessary to pin to a
# working commit. Also, specific branches in indirect dependencies
# seem to be ignored, so we list them here too.
